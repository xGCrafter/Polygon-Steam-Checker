# What is "Polysteam - Free"?
"Polysteam - Free" is a tool for checking Steam account credentials, created by GCrafter. This is the free, slower version of Polysteam - Premium.
It allows users to check a steam accounts' credentials and see if they are valid or not.

Note: Skidding/Leaching/Redistributing without credit/permission is prohibited! 

# Features

- Checks for Valid/Invalid Accounts (2FA Checking in Premium!)
- Supports HTTP(S) proxies (format: user:pass@ip:port or ip:port). 
- Saves results to output/results.txt.
- Auto creates output folder if it doesn't exist.
- Live Dashboard
- Saves Configs to config.json
- Saves Rate limited to rate_limits.log (Premium gets little to no rate limits)
- The checking method of 'Free' is different from the checking method of 'Premium', hence attempting to skid will not get results of our paid checker.

This version is a free version of Polysteam - Premium, i.e it is slower and lacks in features such as VAC ban detection, game library capture, 2FA detection, and uses a much slower checking method.
